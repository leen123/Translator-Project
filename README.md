# Translator Project

An academic project for the College of Information Technology, focused on creating a new language that combines HTML and PHP for simplified web page and controller creation. The project leverages Java 11 and the ANTLR library for implementation.

## Overview

The Translator Project aims to develop a new programming language that simplifies the creation of web pages and controllers by combining elements of HTML and PHP. This language allows developers to create web pages containing buttons, text fields, checkboxes, images, and more using straightforward commands, typically no longer than a single line for each component. Additionally, developers can create controllers for these pages, incorporating loops, conditions, basic operations, page transitions, and more.

The Translator Project converts the code written in this new language into HTML pages and PHP files, generating a dedicated file for each controller and web page. The project includes a comprehensive report that describes its purpose, implementation details, and provides examples of the constructed language and how to write in it.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following software/tools:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- ANTLR library (version X.X.X)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translator-project.git
2. Set up the ANTLR library in your development environment.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
4. Build and run the project.

## Usage

1. Define web pages and controllers using the newly created language.
2. Execute the conversion process to generate HTML and PHP files.
3. Deploy the resulting web pages and controllers.

## Features

- Custom programming language for web development
- Simple syntax for creating web pages and controllers
- Automated conversion of code into HTML and PHP files
